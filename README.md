# emergency-room-plotter

Script using GeoPandas that takes a list of points (trauma centers in and near California) and a polygon (California) and subdivides the polygon into a polygon per point (1km resolution).

Any point within a trauma center's polygon indicates that trauma center is the closest to that point.
